# emba {-}

[emba] is an acronym for *Ensemble (boolean) Model Biomarker Analysis*.

It's an `R` package made to analyze the [models produced by Gitsbe](#gitsbe-output) with regards to their predictive performance and synergy prediction output and find important nodes (biomarkers) in the studied boolean networks that make these models predict specific (experimentally observed) synergies or produce better overall prediction performance.
