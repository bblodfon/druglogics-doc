# Intro {-}

This is an online documentation for any software package that is related to the [druglogics GitHub organisation](https://github.com/druglogics/). 
If there is a need for extra information that is not in the `README.md` file of the respective package, it will be here most probably.

Created using the bookdown package [@bookdown2016].
