# Intro {-}

This is an online documentation for some of the software packages in the [druglogics GitHub organisation](https://github.com/druglogics/). 
It's created using the bookdown package [@bookdown2016].
Currently the documentation includes the modules:

- [Druglogics-Synergy]
- [Gitsbe]
- [Drabme]

:::{.caution}
The modules are currently in **private BitBucket repos** and will be publicly released in Github when the related publication gets accepted :)
