It’s created using the bookdown package (Xie 2016). The following packages are fully documented in this manual: Gitsbe Drabme Other DrugLogics-related packages (documented in their respective repositories) are: druglogics-synergy A small package which runs sequentially Gitsbe and then Drabme, to make it easier for users to execute/test the two pipeline packages in one go. druglogics-roc R shiny app that was built to use the results from Drabme’s ensemble-wise synergies output file and produce a ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) and a PR (Precision-Recall) curve in order to assess the performance of Drabme’s synergy classifier/predictor. abmlog A generator of all possible boolean models with link operators. emba The Java-based packages are currently in private BitBucket repositories and will be publicly released in Github when the relevant publication gets accepted :) "]]
