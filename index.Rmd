# Intro {-}

This is an online documentation for some of the software packages in the [druglogics GitHub organisation](https://github.com/druglogics/).
It's created using the bookdown package [@bookdown2016].
Currently the documentation includes the packages:

- [Gitsbe]
- [Drabme]

This project was born because the above packages have a lot of configuration options that we needed to clarify and properly document and in the end they are the heart of the DrugLogics pipeline.

:::{.caution}
The packages are currently in **private BitBucket repos** and will be publicly released in Github when the related publication gets accepted :)
