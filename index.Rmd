# Introduction {-}

This is an online documentation for some of the software packages in the [druglogics GitHub organisation](https://github.com/druglogics/).
It's created using the bookdown package [@bookdown2016].
Currently the documentation includes the packages:

- [Gitsbe]
- [Drabme]
- [emba]

---

We have implemented a small package called `druglogics-synergy` which runs sequentially Gitsbe and then Drabme, to make it easier for users to execute/test the two pipeline packages in one go.
See documentation in the respective [BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/asmundf/druglogics-synergy/src/master/).

:::{.caution}
The packages are currently in **private BitBucket repositories** and will be publicly released in Github when the relevant publication gets accepted :)
